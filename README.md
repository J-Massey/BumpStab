# Assess the Stability of a Swimming Foil

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to assessing the stability of a swimming foil. It provides tools and scripts to read, process, and visualize the flow field data of a swimming foil.

## Features
- **Flow Field Data Processing**: Efficiently read and process the flow field data of a swimming foil.
- **SPOD Plotting**: Utilize PySPOD to generate and visualize Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD) plots.
- **DMD Computation**: Compute the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- **Resolvent Analysis**: Extract and analyze the resolvent to understand the flow dynamics.
- **Rank Truncation Suitability**: Assess the suitability of rank truncation for the given data.
- **Resolvent Modes Visualization**: Plot and visualize the resolvent modes to gain insights into the flow behavior.
